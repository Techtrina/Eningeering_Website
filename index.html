 9-2-22: These past few days we've done tinkercad, a new challenge, and started our first project on mechanical engineering called The Rube Goldberg Simple Machine. We learned about what other types of engineering there are. We got onto tinkercad to create 3d models (to scale) for our project. We started our project this week creating a model of how to pop a balloon, while a starting with a baseball. Everything must be to scale when we create the project with cardboard and other materials. Our last challenge involved tinkercad of creating/trying to create an exact replica of a home appliance.

 9-16-22: The last 2 weeks in class we've started creating our projects on tinrkercad. We finished them adn then were divided into groups of 4. Once in our groups we explained and looked at their cads and chose what parts we needed to create our project. We each took one part from our individual cads and put them together in a single cad. Then we rearranged them to make one final design before building. Once we finished our cad we started to build our project with cardboard and tape. My group was able to get all of our parts done and we started putting them together. When we got to constructing our pully system, we ran into a few problems. We had to needed to create a new base for the pully and measured how much string we need to use. Once we finish our base we will be able to finish putting all the parts together and then we can test it. Aside from our project, yesterday we did a challenge involving paper. We had to use one piece of paper to hold an object that was water proof. The piece of paper floated in water for 5 minutes holidng a water proof object. My group of 4 tried building a paper boat which ultimately we messed up. So we started folding the paper to have sides and then we put 4 quarters inside. We were group 1 and went first with 3 other groups. Many of the other groups that went after and with our group got water loged or sank. Our "boat" showed no signs of water or sinking. Of everyones boat I think that team 1 (my team) deserves to be in the top 3 or 5. The other boat that did well was one that didn't fold anything and it was just a flat piece of paper. Although it was only holding 2 other boats that sank. The other boat that was funny was one that had around 5 pens, 5 glue sticks and 4 dry erase markers.

 9-26-22: Last friday on the 23 of september we made our final touches to our projects and then competed. We had to exlplain what we were doing, what mechanisms were used and what would happen. My group was the only group to work on the first run. The other groups had trouble popping the balloon. The other groups were very different and had very interesting ideas of how to pop the balloon. I think my group's project was one of the most simple looking ones.

 9-30-22: In the past week my class has started on our next engineeiring, Bioengineering. The last week we did a CAD having to creating a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I made a prosthetic for a cat and did the front leg. The video link is my favorite anime tv show called K (k project). It's a funny clip in the second season (K Return of Kings).The other link is one of my favorite songs from Prince called "Wherever U Go , Whatever U Do".

10-7-22: This week we had a project on disassembling a computer and then putting it back togther. As well as, filling out a worksheet on all the different parts of the computer and trying to figure out what part is what and what it does/where is goes. Yesterday we had a challenge where half the class had to estimate how many doors there were on campus (school owned) and the other half (my side) had to do wheels. Once everyone had an estimate of how many wheels and doors, we were aloud to go outsdie of the classroom and roam the school. In partners, me and my partner counted around 2500 wheels in the school, including chairs, carts, cars, bikes, mobile whiteboards, ping pong tables and a few toy cars.
