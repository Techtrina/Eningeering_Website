 9-2-22: These past few days we've done tinkercad, a new challenge, and started our first project on mechanical engineering called The Rube Goldberg Simple Machine. We learned about what other types of engineering there are. We got onto tinkercad to create 3d models (to scale) for our project. We started our project this week creating a model of how to pop a balloon, while a starting with a baseball. Everything must be to scale when we create the project with cardboard and other materials. Our last challenge involved tinkercad of creating/trying to create an exact replica of a home appliance.

 9-16-22: The last 2 weeks in class we've started creating our projects on tinrkercad. We finished them adn then were divided into groups of 4. Once in our groups we explained and looked at their cads and chose what parts we needed to create our project. We each took one part from our individual cads and put them together in a single cad. Then we rearranged them to make one final design before building. Once we finished our cad we started to build our project with cardboard and tape. My group was able to get all of our parts done and we started putting them together. When we got to constructing our pully system, we ran into a few problems. We had to needed to create a new base for the pully and measured how much string we need to use. Once we finish our base we will be able to finish putting all the parts together and then we can test it. Aside from our project, yesterday we did a challenge involving paper. We had to use one piece of paper to hold an object that was water proof. The piece of paper floated in water for 5 minutes holidng a water proof object. My group of 4 tried building a paper boat which ultimately we messed up. So we started folding the paper to have sides and then we put 4 quarters inside. We were group 1 and went first with 3 other groups. Many of the other groups that went after and with our group got water loged or sank. Our "boat" showed no signs of water or sinking. Of everyones boat I think that team 1 (my team) deserves to be in the top 3 or 5. The other boat that did well was one that didn't fold anything and it was just a flat piece of paper. Although it was only holding 2 other boats that sank. The other boat that was funny was one that had around 5 pens, 5 glue sticks and 4 dry erase markers.

 9-26-22: Last friday on the 23 of september we made our final touches to our projects and then competed. We had to exlplain what we were doing, what mechanisms were used and what would happen. My group was the only group to work on the first run. The other groups had trouble popping the balloon. The other groups were very different and had very interesting ideas of how to pop the balloon. I think my group's project was one of the most simple looking ones.

 9-30-22: In the past week my class has started on our next engineeiring, Bioengineering. The last week we did a CAD having to creating a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I made a prosthetic for a cat and did the front leg. The video link is my favorite anime tv show called K (k project). It's a funny clip in the second season (K Return of Kings).The other link is one of my favorite songs from Prince called "Wherever U Go , Whatever U Do".

10-7-22: This week we had a project on disassembling a computer and then putting it back togther. As well as, filling out a worksheet on all the different parts of the computer and trying to figure out what part is what and what it does/where is goes. Yesterday we had a challenge where half the class had to estimate how many doors there were on campus (school owned) and the other half (my side) had to do wheels. Once everyone had an estimate of how many wheels and doors, we were aloud to go outsdie of the classroom and roam the school. In partners, me and my partner counted around 2500 wheels in the school, including chairs, carts, cars, bikes, mobile whiteboards, ping pong tables and a few toy cars.

 10-21-22: Last week we started Areospace engineering. We learned about the different facts of a rocket which include drag, weight, thrust and lift. We started out by sketching out our bottle rockets and our BOM. We didn't build an actualy bomb but we build a BOM which stands for Bill of Materials (a list of our needed materials for our bottled rocket). Then we started to build our bottled rocket. Our goal was to be able to launch it 10 meters away from our football feild's feild goal. It took about 4 days to make our bottled rocket, working in teams of 3 or 2. We used plastic coke bottles which were 2 ounces.  My team ended up scapping the first rocket we made due to it not being pressurized. Our first rocket was letting air out which led to us having to get a new bottle. Thoday we had to launch our rockets and because our first bottle didnt pressurize, we sent the first half of class making a new bottled rocket. We had to dump out a full bottle of coke into a drinking fountain in order to use the bottle. We cut off the wngs and tail of the oringinal bottle and hot glued it to the new one. When we had finished hot gluing the wings we put the nose of the rocket on, made of cardboard paper. When the glue was mostly dried, my group headed back to the field where our class was launhing the rockets . The first picture is our sketch of our rocket and our BOM. We also CADed our rocket to size. The rocket on the table is ur original. The next image is what the orgial looked like after the wings, tail and nose were cut off. The bottle outside on the bench is our second one witht he same wings, tail and nose. We also had pictures of where we launched and a video of our bottle being launched.

  11-4-22: Last week we were introduced to Environmental engineering. We did created a filter for water made of a plastic bottle. We cut the bottle a little less than half and then we turned it upside down using the opening of the bottle as our base. we put a cotton ball at the very bottom of the plastic bottle then put sand, pebbles and rocks in the bottle. After that we put dirty water in the bottle and used the other half of the bottle for the clean water to fitler into. The next week we started Electrical engineering. we started by learning some of the formulas and what volts, amps and ohms are. We started to breadboard on tinkercad and learned how to light up 3 LED lights. To do so before we had to learn the math inorder to calculate the resistor.

   11-9-22: This weeek we continued to bread board but this time it wasn't on tinker cad. We did this with the real materials with a partner. We also had a challenge day today. Would you rather take a regular math class for the rest of the year (about an every every day) or write out 1,000,000? Me and my partner chose to take a math class. We chose this becasue it's more practical, less time consuming, allows the brain to learn and grwo when faced with real world problems. It also forces your brain to problem solve and stimulates the brain. Writting down 1 million would be a waste of time.

   11-18-22: This last week we've continued to work on our breadboard with our partners. We've been making different circuits and learned how to program them. Yesterday we had another challenge with Environmental Engineering. It was about a 10 square mile reservoir containiing bromide and chlorine. When combined with sunlight Bromide and chlorine create Bromate which can cause a specific type of cancer. There are 600,000 people who depend on this water. What is the fastest way to clean this water? We did this challenge in pairs. My teammate and I thought about many different solutions, seeing if they were practical and or how long it would take. Our final solution was to pump out all the water in the reservoir and move it into an indoor facility. We would heat the water up to 90 degrees inorder to get rid of the Bromate in the water. When heating the water, the evaporated water would travel to a different machine which would then cool the water and filter it. After that you would be able to drink the water. This process would take around 3-4 months and it would cost $1.5-2 million. Today my sister Mckenna is coming back from San Fransico state (goes to college in SF) for Thanksgiving. This Thanksgiving my family is going to spend it with my aunt and oncle and my 2 younger cousins. Typically we would have it with all my family including my other aunts, oncles and grandparents. Every Thanksgiving at night me and my family watch A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. We watch Charlie Brown on Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and during the spring/St. Patricks day.
