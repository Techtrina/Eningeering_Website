 9-2-22: These past few days we've done tinkercad, a new challenge, and started our first project on mechanical engineering called The Rube Goldberg Simple Machine. We learned about what other types of engineering there are. We got onto tinkercad to create 3d models (to scale) for our project. We started our project this week creating a model of how to pop a balloon, while a starting with a baseball. Everything must be to scale when we create the project with cardboard and other materials. Our last challenge involved tinkercad of creating/trying to create an exact replica of a home appliance.

 9-16-22: The last 2 weeks in class we've started creating our projects on tinrkercad. We finished them adn then were divided into groups of 4. Once in our groups we explained and looked at their cads and chose what parts we needed to create our project. We each took one part from our individual cads and put them together in a single cad. Then we rearranged them to make one final design before building. Once we finished our cad we started to build our project with cardboard and tape. My group was able to get all of our parts done and we started putting them together. When we got to constructing our pully system, we ran into a few problems. We had to needed to create a new base for the pully and measured how much string we need to use. Once we finish our base we will be able to finish putting all the parts together and then we can test it. Aside from our project, yesterday we did a challenge involving paper. We had to use one piece of paper to hold an object that was water proof. The piece of paper floated in water for 5 minutes holidng a water proof object. My group of 4 tried building a paper boat which ultimately we messed up. So we started folding the paper to have sides and then we put 4 quarters inside. We were group 1 and went first with 3 other groups. Many of the other groups that went after and with our group got water loged or sank. Our "boat" showed no signs of water or sinking. Of everyones boat I think that team 1 (my team) deserves to be in the top 3 or 5. The other boat that did well was one that didn't fold anything and it was just a flat piece of paper. Although it was only holding 2 other boats that sank. The other boat that was funny was one that had around 5 pens, 5 glue sticks and 4 dry erase markers.

 9-26-22: Last friday on the 23 of september we made our final touches to our projects and then competed. We had to exlplain what we were doing, what mechanisms were used and what would happen. My group was the only group to work on the first run. The other groups had trouble popping the balloon. The other groups were very different and had very interesting ideas of how to pop the balloon. I think my group's project was one of the most simple looking ones.

 9-30-22: In the past week my class has started on our next engineeiring, Bioengineering. The last week we did a CAD having to creating a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I made a prosthetic for a cat and did the front leg. The video link is my favorite anime tv show called K (k project). It's a funny clip in the second season (K Return of Kings).The other link is one of my favorite songs from Prince called "Wherever U Go , Whatever U Do".

10-7-22: This week we had a project on disassembling a computer and then putting it back togther. As well as, filling out a worksheet on all the different parts of the computer and trying to figure out what part is what and what it does/where is goes. Yesterday we had a challenge where half the class had to estimate how many doors there were on campus (school owned) and the other half (my side) had to do wheels. Once everyone had an estimate of how many wheels and doors, we were aloud to go outsdie of the classroom and roam the school. In partners, me and my partner counted around 2500 wheels in the school, including chairs, carts, cars, bikes, mobile whiteboards, ping pong tables and a few toy cars.

 10-21-22: Last week we started Areospace engineering. We learned about the different facts of a rocket which include drag, weight, thrust and lift. We started out by sketching out our bottle rockets and our BOM. We didn't build an actualy bomb but we build a BOM which stands for Bill of Materials (a list of our needed materials for our bottled rocket). Then we started to build our bottled rocket. Our goal was to be able to launch it 10 meters away from our football feild's feild goal. It took about 4 days to make our bottled rocket, working in teams of 3 or 2. We used plastic coke bottles which were 2 ounces.  My team ended up scapping the first rocket we made due to it not being pressurized. Our first rocket was letting air out which led to us having to get a new bottle. Thoday we had to launch our rockets and because our first bottle didnt pressurize, we sent the first half of class making a new bottled rocket. We had to dump out a full bottle of coke into a drinking fountain in order to use the bottle. We cut off the wngs and tail of the oringinal bottle and hot glued it to the new one. When we had finished hot gluing the wings we put the nose of the rocket on, made of cardboard paper. When the glue was mostly dried, my group headed back to the field where our class was launhing the rockets . The first picture is our sketch of our rocket and our BOM. We also CADed our rocket to size. The rocket on the table is ur original. The next image is what the orgial looked like after the wings, tail and nose were cut off. The bottle outside on the bench is our second one witht he same wings, tail and nose. We also had pictures of where we launched and a video of our bottle being launched.

  11-4-22: Last week we were introduced to Environmental engineering. We did created a filter for water made of a plastic bottle. We cut the bottle a little less than half and then we turned it upside down using the opening of the bottle as our base. we put a cotton ball at the very bottom of the plastic bottle then put sand, pebbles and rocks in the bottle. After that we put dirty water in the bottle and used the other half of the bottle for the clean water to fitler into. The next week we started Electrical engineering. we started by learning some of the formulas and what volts, amps and ohms are. We started to breadboard on tinkercad and learned how to light up 3 LED lights. To do so before we had to learn the math inorder to calculate the resistor.

   11-9-22: This weeek we continued to bread board but this time it wasn't on tinker cad. We did this with the real materials with a partner. We also had a challenge day today. Would you rather take a regular math class for the rest of the year (about an every every day) or write out 1,000,000? Me and my partner chose to take a math class. We chose this becasue it's more practical, less time consuming, allows the brain to learn and grwo when faced with real world problems. It also forces your brain to problem solve and stimulates the brain. Writting down 1 million would be a waste of time.

   11-18-22: This last week we've continued to work on our breadboard with our partners. We've been making different circuits and learned how to program them. Yesterday we had another challenge with Environmental Engineering. It was about a 10 square mile reservoir containiing bromide and chlorine. When combined with sunlight Bromide and chlorine create Bromate which can cause a specific type of cancer. There are 600,000 people who depend on this water. What is the fastest way to clean this water? We did this challenge in pairs. My teammate and I thought about many different solutions, seeing if they were practical and or how long it would take. Our final solution was to pump out all the water in the reservoir and move it into an indoor facility. We would heat the water up to 90 degrees inorder to get rid of the Bromate in the water. When heating the water, the evaporated water would travel to a different machine which would then cool the water and filter it. After that you would be able to drink the water. This process would take around 3-4 months and it would cost $1.5-2 million. Today my sister Mckenna is coming back from San Fransico state (goes to college in SF) for Thanksgiving. This Thanksgiving my family is going to spend it with my aunt and oncle and my 2 younger cousins. Typically we would have it with all my family including my other aunts, oncles and grandparents. Every Thanksgiving at night me and my family watch A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. We watch Charlie Brown on Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and during the spring/St. Patricks day.

   12-2-22: The week coming back from Thanksgiving break, we started Civil Engineering. A type of Engineering that works/focuses on the building and construction of buildings, bridges, roads, etc. For our final this semester we are going to create a bridge made out of spagetti. It must be 2 feet long and will be tested using a bucket filled with water. We are aloud 100 pieces of spagetti in total but the final project will be 20 pieces. We are doing this in groups of 4. My group started to create/discuss ideas and designs. We decided to make our bridge somewhat like a train track with a prism type shape. We cadded our design and yesterday we started to build it using glue. With only 100 pieces in total for the next 3 weeks. We only have 4 total trys until the final project of 20 pieces. The other day we started to glue out pieces together to create the framing of our bridge. This project will be graded individually, and depending on how durable the bridge is also affects the score.

   <p>
    12-14/16-22: This week and last week we continued to work on our final projects for this semester. While making out bridge it was difficult to take them off the carboard when it dried. To solve this we had to put tissue paper underneath. Although this helped, because the dried/glued pasta was dry, it kept breaking because of how fragile it was. The bridge kept breaking which caused a few set backs. In the CAD we originally were going to make it square shaped, but decided to make it triangle shaped instead. This would let us use less pasta. We also decided to start another bridge while also working on the first one. Our group divided into 2 teams, one for the first bridge and the other for the second one. This we tested the the second bridge and started a third bridge just in case. Today we finished the first bridge and going to test it the next day. The 3D bridge is our original design however we changed the shape. The second bridge was based off of train tracks having an X patteren. The thrid bridge was made just incase the other 2 didn't work or broke. The last one actually did the best out of all 3 bridges when we tested them.  For the final project we also have to create a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aTFoHti4CjcM0LcC6ftNsxDJyiolDkpfpiHZd-ys9T4/edit#slide=id.p">presentation</a> about our process. This includes our process, an analysis, pictures and what we could improve on or what we would do differently.

    1-13-23: During the break I hung out with my family and friends. Because of the grounded/canceled flights my parents weren't here for christmas eve or day. So instead we did Christmas when they got back and then had New years the next day. During the time that my parents were gone I was with my two older sisters. We watched movies, decorated, made cookies, played board games and had a lot of mashed potatoes. On New years eve we all played scrable and at the end of the game we learned that if you use all 7 of your letters in a turn you get 50 extra points. The first week back from winter break we started Business engineering. We watched a video of Shark tank to better understand how to determine wether or not the company would be invested. We learned what different parts are needed in order to create a company. We started a mini project on this creating a product and presenting it to 3 "sharks". Our groups project (group of 3) decided on creating an eraser and the more you use it/ wear it down, it will reveal a mountain. The eraser it also scented to calm and sooth the person using it. We created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dg1mZDmmZYexSm-i8Eydtz1lKuWMi69IHysGeiLndYk/edit#slide=id.p">presentation</a> to show how much it costs to make the product, what we price it at, our companies profit, and how we advertise.
   </p>
   <p>
    1-19-23: This week we started/finished presentaions about our companies. We had various products in our classroom such as teleportation, a tire company, and making snow. I learend that when making a buissnes and creating a proposal for invenstmens, there are many parts. When listening to the questions about the products themselves and when an offer was made, I learned that there are many different ways to make an offer. Different offers have different aspects and different amounts baised on how well the company is doing, what the company's net worth is and many other parts. Depening on the offer you can get a better or worse deal depending on how well the "sharks" think your company will do or will progress will determine their offer. I also learned that there are various ways to get money invested in your company. There were a few companies that hadn't actually started on production or made sales. But rather they had only done research and made prototypes. Overall this project helped me understand all the aspects about how to start a company and what decisions are made to make the company successful.

    1-27-23: Last week we did the last time of engineering called chemical engineering. We did a project on this and created a substancs that is neither a liquid or solide. Unfortunately I was absent that day because I was at the dentist. In the past week we went over our final project for this year. We had 3 options to build a Mousetrap Car, an Electric Arduino Car or a Campus Research Project. I chose the electric arduino car which involves computer and electrical engineering. This involves programming with arduino and making a remote control car. I chose this project as my final becasue I've always been interested in understanding how to code. I believe that it would help me in the long run when going into Animation as a career. The first week of this project was a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1enuROjo2JmRmJ19Xd2zHBZEWsb9_Fa8thvx2sdKk_4E/edit">project proposal</a> which must be 5-6 pages long. The second week is CADing and creating the design. The 3rd and 4th week is for building. The 5th and 6th week will be testing, modifying and reviewing. Then the last week of school/the 6th week will be presenting or showing our projects to the class. 
   </p>
   <p>
    2-3-23: During the first week of Febuary, we started CADing our designs for our final project. We didn't work on Wednesday due to a school lock down. The next day on thursday we did a challenge. We were given 15 sticky notes and we could do whatever we wanted with them such as using scissors to cut them, in order to make the longest bridge. We worked in pairs and my group got second place, being 101 inches long.

    2-10-23: This week we started to build our final projects. I started by building the base out of cardboard. I decided to cut out 2 of the same bases of of cardboard and then hot glue them together. However when I was able to scale the size of the wheels/motor, I had to make a new base inorder to fit the size of having only 2 wheels for the arduino car. If the 2 wheels doesn't work then I'll have to make sure the base can chnage into using 4 wheels. Because of this issues I had to make sure my base fit 2 wheels and 4 wheels with holes in the middle for the wires to connect to the arudino and the dc motor. So far this week I've only cut out one part of the base. I'll make another one ands glue them together juist like the oringinal inorder to keep the base sturdy. This thursday we did a challenge with a meter stick. We had to creat a device that would hold a water balloon duck taped to the last 15cm of the meter stick and get it across the football field as fast as possible, without making or popping the water balloon. We could only use popsicle sticks and rubber bands to make the device. We had groups of 3. Our overall device was weird looking but when we got down to the field it was the best one made. When it came down to going across the field as fast as possible, my group won.

    2-17-23: In the last week, I continued to build my arduino chassis. I had to make many adjustments to the base. At first I was going to make it so that all four motors could fit by using zip ties. In order to do so I had to cut different holes into the base. I made two of the same base and then ot glued them together. However, I realized that I had to make the base longer and I could only use two motors instead of four. The two other wheels would have t be discs. Because of the size difference in wheels I had to make the base long and put up a "wall" inorder for the chassis to be leveled. After zip tiying the two motors in he front, I hot glued the walls to the base and cut two hole in them and put a skewer through them. After that I hot glued cardboard to the discs in order to keep them level with the other wheels. After that I hot glued the discs onto the skewer and let them dry. Once the wheels were attached to the chassis I could then start ataching the arduino and motor.    
   </p>
   <p>
    2-24-23: Next Wednesday our final projects are due. This week I wired the arudino to the breadboard. Wirering them, at first was confusing but once I understood what to do it went by quickely. Then after I connected everything, I had to soughter my motors. The first thing I had to do was strip the wires. This part was difficult because I kept accidentally cuting the wire shorter and shorter each time I tried. Eventually I was able to get them stripped after having someone teach/do it for me. Then I soughtered the motors which took some getting used to the smoke. After I soughter them I had to reconnect my motors to the chassis with zip ties. After that I had to put the wires soughtered to the motors through the chassis hole I made, to connect it to the breadboard and arduino. When trying to connect them It was very diffuicult because I had to get around all the other wires. Eventually I was able to connect everything. Lastly I had to keep the breadboard and arduino from falling off the chassis when it moves. I used string to tie it and then hot glued each side. After that I put the wheels back on and connected it to my computer. I wrote the code for the arduino car and then uploaded the code to the car. It was my first time testing the car and it worked perfectly. Starting today and next week I'll do more research on how to add more advanced controls to the code.

    3-3-23: This we finished our projects on wednesday in the first few minutes of class. After that we went down to the cafiteria and "raced" our arduino cars or mouse trap cars. In the begining of the week I added a 9 volt battery to the arduino and had to put duck tape on the disc wheels in order to add more tracktion. I did this becasue I had to keep my car from turning left. The tape helped a little but because my wheels weren't centered, they were wobbly. Because I didn't center the wheels the car kept turning. In the cafiteria, first we raced all the mouse trap cars and then the arduino. The last race was all the arduino and mouse trap cars. If my car didn't turn I think it wouldv'e won the race/would go the furtherest. After finishing this project, I learned how to wire and program the car. I was able to better understand how everthing worked. I also learned how to soughter my wheels which I found to be quite interesting. I've never done anything similar to it so I was pleased with the experiance of learning how to soughter them. I also realized that it's not as hard or complicated to make a car that can move or understand simple commands. If I were to make another arduino, I think I'd have a much easier time of creating the base/body of the car. In this sense I didn't really understand how I was going to connect everything since I couldn't glue everything together. I'm glad that I chose to make the arduino car over the mouse trap car. At first in the begining of the project when deciding which one to choose, I originally thought about doing the mouse trap or the research project. But I decided to do the arudino because I thought that it would give me a more benifitial experiance.
